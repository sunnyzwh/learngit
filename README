neocomplete is the abbreviation of "neo-completion with cache". It provides
keyword completion system by maintaining a cache of keywords in the current
buffer. neocomplete can be customized easily and has many more features than
Vim's built-in completion.

## Installation

**Note:** neocomplete requires Vim 7.3.885+ with Lua enabled.
See [requirements](#requirements) if you aren't sure whether you have this.

1. Extract the files and put them in your Vim directory
   (usually `~/.vim/` or `Program Files/Vim/vimfiles` on Windows).
2. Execute the `:NeoCompleteEnable` command or set `let g:neocomplete#enable_at_startup = 1`
   in your `.vimrc` (**not** in `.gvimrc` or `_gvimrc`!)

## Requirements

neocomplete requires Vim 7.3.885+ compiled with [if\_lua](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/if_lua.html).
If `:echo has("lua")` returns `1`, then you're done; otherwise, see below.
